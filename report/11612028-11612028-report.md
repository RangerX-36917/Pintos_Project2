## Brief Design Notes
* Use `strtok_r()` to parse command line arguments. I created a string array `argv[argc]` to store them and then push them into the stack in reverse order. The stack should be set up carefully.
* Add a struct `child_thread` in `thread.h` which will become elements of a threads child list. Use this child list to keep track of status of child threads. This also enables us to read exit status after the child thread has exited.
* Add a struct `opened_file` in `file.h`. Again this is used to store all opened files of a thread as a list.
* Use a global file lock defined in `thread.h` to ensure thread-safety on file aceess. (with bugs) 
## Final Report Questions
* A reflection on the projectâ€“what exactly did each member do? What went well, and what could be improved?
    * I don't have a teamate this time.
    * The argument-parsing and basic system calls are finished. However, two tests (*multi-oom* and *sync-read*) failed. I didn't manage to fix them before the deadline.
* Does your code exhibit any major memory safety problems (especially regarding C strings), memory leaks, poor error handling, or race conditions?
    * There may be some problem during parsing args. The arguments are passed and manipulated by pointers (`char*`). Therefore, any casual `free` operation can cause unknown problem in the future. This is very hard to solve. Without `free`, memory leakage is possible.
    * Test *multi-oom* shows some problem with `lock_release()` and test *sync-read* didn't pass properly. There may be some synchronization issues in my code that is not fixed.
* Did you use consistent code style? Your code should blend in with the existing Pintos code. Check your use of indentation, your spacing, and your naming conventions
    * I tried my best to keep a uniform code style with original pintos code.
* Is your code simple and easy to understand?
    * I think so.
* If you have very complex sections of code in your solution, did you add enough comments to explain them?
    * I added some comments to where I consider is important.
* Did you leave commented-out code in your final submission?
    * NO.
* Did you copy-paste code instead of creating reusable functions?
    * I did my best to improve code reusability. e.g. I extracted argumant checking in `syscall.c` to `verify_.
